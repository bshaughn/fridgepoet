    Open Issues
       // magnets with multiple words crash into each other on drag, hard-code HTML spaces between words, doing so in inspector confirms a fix
	dragging magnet with 3 words causes text to smash together when it hits the word bin boundary
        sometimes for unknown reasons, several messages are broadcasted/logged when a user moves a newly introduced word
        "new word" and "moved" messages are logged when a new word is introduced. Should only show "new word" message
        sometimes if a user refreshes the page their old cursor isn't deleted from other users' fridge but a new one is created
	slicer sometimes returns “undefined”
	slicer - remove proper Nouns?
	slicer - capitalization

    Always
