    Open Issues
       // magnets with multiple words crash into each other on drag, hard-code HTML spaces between words, doing so in inspector confirms a fix
	//dragging magnet with 3 words causes text to smash together when it hits the word bin boundary
       ->fixed! Corrected Slicer to remove newline characters between words in a tile
        sometimes for unknown reasons, several messages are broadcasted/logged when a user moves a newly introduced word
        multiple binding issue...
        "new word" and "moved" messages are logged when a new word is introduced. Should only show "new word" message
        sometimes if a user refreshes the page their old cursor isn't deleted from other users' fridge but a new one is created
	//slicer sometimes returns “undefined”
       ->fixed! It was a matter of making sure the client only looks for 25 words :)
	slicer - remove proper Nouns?
	//slicer - capitalization
       ->fixed! Removing line breaks in a word chunk fixed this and also the word-crunch-on-drag issue

    Always
        REFACTOR + IMPROVE

  Next steps:
   import more text sources, maybe "The Raven”, Moby Dick, The Odyssey, War & Peace, Crime & Punishment, Salman Rushdie (Satanic Verses or Midnights Children), 1984.
      Let’s add like 25 more texts and see how it runs
